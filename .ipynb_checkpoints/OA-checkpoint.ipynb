    "I will first describe my thought process for a brute force approach. I will then consider the reasons for the shortcomings of the brute force approach, and use those to try to come up\n",
    "with a more optimal one. \n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, we are going to be receiving a constant input stream of characters, and we need to check if any substring of the entire stream so far matches any of the registered \n",
    "keypress_sequences. The most simple thing we can do is maintain a single string representing the entire character stream. Everytime we receive an additional character, we will append that\n",
    "character to our string, and then look at every substring in our new string. For each substring, we need to compare it to every single keypress_sequence that we have registered to see\n",
    "if there is a match.\n",
    "\n",
    "This brute force approach is extremely inefficient. Let n be the number of keypress_sequences registered. Let L be the average length of a keypress_sequence. Let m be the current size\n",
    "of the character stream (which is represented as a single string that we are maintaining). Then the big-O runtime of the keypress() function will be O(m^3 * n * L). \n",
    "This is because, in general, for a string of length m, there are O(m^2) substrings. The length of each substring is on the order of O(m), so in total it takes O(m^3) time \n",
    "to build every substring. For each substring, we have to compare it to each of the n keypress_sequences. Each such comparison\n",
    "takes O(L) time, because, under the hood, checking for string equality is done by iterating through the strings being compared.\n",
    "\n",
    "This brute force approach is inefficient because it does repeated work by finding every substring after every keypress. We will end up creating many of the same substrings between\n",
    "keypresses. It is also fundamentally inefficient to compare our keypress stream with the keypress_sequences AFTER a key has been pressed. It makes more sense for us to have a way to \n",
    "continuously be trying to match characters with keypress_sequences AS we are receiving new characters in our stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more efficient approach would be to use a trie. The reason why it seems natural to use a trie is that a trie allows us to try to match an incoming character with the next character\n",
    "of a string whose prefix we have already partially matched so far. This marginal character comparison allows us to avoid the inefficiency of comparing our entire stream with every string \n",
    "after each character insertion. \n",
    "\n",
    "Practically, for our trie implementation, what the register() function will do is add the given keypress_sequence as a string to the trie data structure. Every time that register() is \n",
    "called, a new string will be added to the trie. Visually, each of these strings will be a vertical path of character nodes starting from the root and going down. A trie also has some \n",
    "space advantages, since keypress_sequences that share a prefix will have some shared nodes in the trie. One last detail that we have to keep in mind for the register() function is that\n",
    "we need to store the action_type for each string. To do this, we will simply put the action_type in the last node of the keypress_sequence that was associated with that action_type. \n",
    "That way, when we end up reaching the last node of a string in our trie, we will immediately be able to print out the action_type for that string.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the keypress() function, we will simply traverse down our trie and go to the next character node corresponding to the character key that is given. Our trie implementation will have\n",
    "a hashmap for each node representing the child nodes of that nodes. The key of the hashmap will be a character, and the value will be another node. \n",
    "To go to the next character node in the trie, we simply move a pointer from our current node to the value of the children hashmap at the key equal to the character, which is an O(1)*\n",
    "operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one final but important thing that we are missing with our trie implementation. So far, our trie implementation is able to efficiently allow us to traverse down a string \n",
    "in the trie. Everytime we read a new character, we just perform an O(1) operation to go down one node. When we reach the final node, we print out the action_type at that node.\n",
    "The problem is that this strategy is not able to consider every substring of the character stream. This is because, once we go down the first node in our trie, we never try going back up\n",
    "and starting again from another node. For example, if we have registered \"UDLR\" with the action_type \"Run\", then we will go to U in our trie, then to D, L, and finally R, where we will\n",
    "print out \"Run\". Imagine that we had also registered \"DLRR\" with the action_type \"Jump\" in our trie. Then this string would be a separate chain of nodes from \"UDLR\", since these \n",
    "strings start with different characters. Then, if we received the character stream \"UDLRR\", we would be able to catch \"Run\", but we would not be able to catch \"Jump\", because we never\n",
    "started going down the path with \"DLRR\" in our trie. We only started going down the path with \"UDLR\", and we only continued down that singular path.\n",
    "\n",
    "This issue implies that, somehow, we need a way to go back up our trie and try to go down different paths every time we see a new character in our stream. For example, if we had \"UDLR\"\n",
    "and \"DLRR\" stored as separate chains of nodes in our trie, and if we had already seen the character \"U\", then we would go down the \"UDLR\" path by one node. Then, if we received \"D\"\n",
    "as our next character, then we would first move down our first path by a second step, so that we have covered \"UD\" in the first chain of nodes. After that, we also want to start another\n",
    "pointer from the root of the trie, and then go down one step by the letter \"D\", so that we have taken one step into the \"DLRR\" chain in our trie. We now have 2 pointers that we are \n",
    "using to traverse through our trie, and when we see a third character, we will likewise move down the first two pointers by one step before starting a third pointer from the root again.\n",
    "This strategy will ensure that we are able to capture substrings of the character stream that don't just start at the very first character we received in our stream. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we use this strategy, then there are a couple of other things we need to consider. Firstly, how many new node pointers will we end up making? It seems that it would be inefficient\n",
    "for us to make a new node pointer for every single new character we see in our stream, since this means that we could potentially be maintaining an infinite amount of node pointers. \n",
    "The solution is that the number of node pointers we need to maintain is exactly the maximum length of a keypress_sequence that we received from our register() function. \n",
    "This is because the purpose of maintaining multiple node pointers is that is allows us to capture substrings starting at different points in our character stream\n",
    "(for example, in the above example where we had \"UDLR\" and \"DLRR\", adding a second node pointer allowed us to look at substrings starting at the second character we saw in our stream,\n",
    "which was \"D\"). This means that we can get rid of old node pointers that we started at points that are farther back than the max length of a keypress_sequence we received.\n",
    "For example, if our character stream was \"UDLRRRRRRR\", and if the biggest keypress_sequence we registered was \"UDLR\", then we would first end up creating a node pointer starting from\n",
    "the character \"U\". After we read in the first \"R\", we have read in 4 characters, so our first node pointer would be at the end of its chain. There is no point in maintaining this node\n",
    "pointer any more, because this node pointer represents a substring that started at \"U\". When we go to the next \"R\" in our character stream, our first node pointer would be trying to \n",
    "capture strings of length 5 if we tried to go down one more step. But the biggest keypress_sequence was of length 4, so there is no point in trying to match a substring of length 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, our keypress() function will have a list of node pointers whose length is equal to the max length of a keypress_sequence registered. We will loop through each node pointer and try\n",
    "to move it down one step in its chain. If we reach an action_type at any of these node pointers, then we will add that to a list of action_types that we have seen. If any node pointer\n",
    "cannot move down to the next character in the input stream because that character is not present in that node's children, then we will move that node pointer back to the top of the trie.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us analyze the complexity of our class. The register() function will take O(L) time, where L is the average length of a keypress_sequence. This is because we simply need to walk down\n",
    "our trie one character at a time, possibly creating and inserting a node for the next character if it's not there. If we insert n keypress_sequences into our trie, then our trie ends up\n",
    "taking O(n*L) space, because we have n chains in our trie, each of which consists of L nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the keypress() function, we will take O(maxlength(keypress_sequence)) time every time we call it. This is because we have exactly maxlength(keypress_sequence) node pointers.\n",
    "Every time keypress() is called, we loop through each node pointer and do an O(1) operation on it to move it down one node."
