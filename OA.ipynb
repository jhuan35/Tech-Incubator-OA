    "Problem: You are making a Game Controller. You need to implement two functions: register() and keypress().The former is called multiple times at the very beginning and never again thereafter. It takes in 2 strings (sequence of characters): a keypress_sequence and an action_type. The semantic meaning there is that once the Game Controller recognizes that a keypress_sequence was received, it should execute the corresponding action_type that was registered. The latter is called every time a key is pressed on the controller. It receives 1 string, a single character of the key pressed. It should return a list of the action_types matched.\n",
